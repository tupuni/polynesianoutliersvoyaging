  abstract = {New Hf isotope and trace element data on mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) from the Pacific Ocean basin are remarkably uniform (176Hf/177Hf≈0.28313–0.28326) and comparable to previously published data [Salters, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 141 (1996) 109–123; Patchett, Lithos 16 (1983) 47–51]. Atlantic MORB have 176Hf/177Hf ranging from 0.28302 to 0.28335 confirming the wide range originally identified by Patchett and Tatsumoto [Geophys. Res. Lett. 7 (1980) 1077–1080]. Indian MORB define an even wider range, from 0.28277 to 0.28337, but three exotic samples have very unradiogenic Hf isotope compositions. Their very low 176Hf/177Hf ratios, together with their trace element characteristics, require the presence of unusual plume-type material beneath the Indian ridge. All other Indian MORB have uniform Hf isotope compositions at about 0.2832, and define a small field displaced to the right of other MORB in Hf–Nd isotope space. The distinct nature of Indian MORB is best explained by the presence in Indian depleted mantle of old recycled oceanic crust and pelagic sediments. Sm/Hf ratios calculated from new high-precision rare earth element and Hf trace element data do not vary in MORB in the same way as in ocean island basalts (OIB): ratios are constant in OIB, but decrease with increasing Sm contents in MORB. The constancy of Sm/Hf in OIB is probably due to an overwhelming influence of residual garnet during melting. By contrast, the decrease of Sm/Hf in MORB is due to the effect of clinopyroxene in the residue of melting beneath ridges, an interpretation confirmed by quantitative modeling of melting. The relationship between Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios in MORB does not require the presence of garnet in the residual mineralogy. The decoupling of Lu/Hf ratios and Hf isotope compositions – the so-called Hf paradox [Salters and Hart, EOS Trans. Am. Geophys. Union 70 (1989) 510] – can be explained by melting dominantly in the spinel field at shallow depths beneath mid-ocean ridges.},

  abstract = {In subduction zones, two major mass fluxes compete: the input flux of altered oceanic crust and sediments subducted into the mantle and the output flux of magma that forms the volcanic arc. While the composition and the amount of material erupted along volcanic arcs are relatively well known, the chemical and isotopic composition of the subducted material (altered oceanic crust and sediments) is poorly constrained and is an important factor in the mass balance calculation. Ocean Drilling Program Leg 185 in the Western Pacific used systematic sampling of the altered basaltic basement and sediment pile and the creation of composite mixtures to quantify the total chemical flux subducted at the Izu-Mariana margin. Here, we report Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of materials recovered from this Leg. The Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of altered basalts from Hole 801C are indistinguishable from those of recent unaltered Pacific mid-ocean ridge basalt, suggesting that hydrothermal alteration had no effect on either isotopic systems. The complete Site 1149 sedimentary pile has a weighted average ɛNd of −5.9 and ɛHf of +4.4, values similar to those of Fe-Mn crusts and nodules. Therefore, the Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of the sediments collected at Site 1149 indicate minimal contributions from continental detrital material to the rare earth elements and high field strength elements. However, the Hf isotopic budget of the oldest sediments is more influenced by continental material than the younger sediments, despite the large distances to continental masses 130 Ma ago. In the Izu subduction zone, we calculate a sedimentary input of less than about 2\% in the volcanic lava source. In contrast, at least 85\% of the sedimentary Nd and Hf are recycled into the mantle to affect its general composition. Assuming that sediments have been recycled in a similar manner into the mantle for millions of years, large chemical heterogeneities must be produced in the mantle. In addition, the depletion of the mantle due to the extraction of continental crust must be partly counterbalanced by the injection of vast quantities of enriched sedimentary material.},

  abstract = {Geochemical studies of geological samples require the precise determination of their major and trace element contents and, when measured, of their isotopic compositions. It is now commonly accepted that the accuracy and precision of geochemical analyses are best estimated by the concomitant analysis of international reference materials run as unknown samples. Although the composition of a wide selection of basalts is relatively well constrained, this is far from being the case for sedimentary materials. We present here a comprehensive set of major and trace element data as well as Nd, Hf, Sr and Pb isotopic compositions for thirteen commonly used international reference materials – eight magmatic rocks (BHVO-2, BR, BE-N, BR 24, AGV-1, BIR-1, UB-N, RGM-1) and five sediments (JLk-1, JSd-1, JSd-2, JSd-3, LKSD-1). We determined the concentrations of over forty elements in the magmatic rocks together with Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic compositions. Our trace element results were both accurate (difference ≤~3\%) and precise (reproducibility at 1s~≤~3\%) and the isotopic results were very similar to other published values. In contrast, we observed a significant chemical and isotopic variability in the sedimentary materials, which we attribute to mineral heterogeneities in the powders. Despite the limitation imposed by this heterogeneity, our work presents a complete set of data determined with a precision not yet achieved in the literature for sedimentary material. We also provide the first Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic measurements for the five sediments, which are commonly used by the geochemical community. Our study of both basalt and sediment reference materials represents a comprehensive and self-consistent set of geochemical data and can therefore be considered as a reference database for the community.},

  abstract = {The scale and geometry of chemical and isotopic heterogeneities in the source of plumes have important scientific implications on the nature, composition and origin of plumes and on the dynamics of mantle mixing over time. Here, we address these issues through the study of Marquesas Islands, one of the Archipelagoes in Polynesia. We present new Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf isotopes as well as trace element data on lavas from several Marquesas Islands and demonstrate that this archipelago consists of two adjacent and distinct rows of islands with significantly different isotopic compositions. For the entire 5.5 Ma construction period, the northern islands, hereafter called the Ua Huka group, has had systematically higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower 206Pb/204Pb ratios than the southern Fatu Hiva group at any given 143Nd/144Nd value. The shape and curvature of mixing arrays preclude the ambient depleted MORB mantle as one of the mixing end-members. We believe therefore that the entire isotopic heterogeneity originates in the plume itself. We suggest that the two Marquesas isotopic stripes originate from partial melting of two adjacent filaments contained in small plumes or “plumelets” that came from a large dome structure located deep in the mantle under Polynesia. Low-degree partial melting under Marquesas and other “weak” Polynesian hot spot chains (Pitcairn-Gambier, Austral-Cook, Society) sample small areas of the dome and preserve source heterogeneities. In contrast, more productive hot spots build up large islands such as Big Island in Hawaii or Réunion Island, and the higher degrees of melting blur the isotopic variability of the plume source.},

  abstract = {Tonga was unique in the prehistoric Pacific for developing a maritime state that integrated the archipelago under a centralized authority and for undertaking long-distance economic and political exchanges in the second millennium A.D. To establish the extent of Tonga’s maritime polity, we geochemically analyzed stone tools excavated from the central places of the ruling paramounts, particularly lithic artifacts associated with stone-faced chiefly tombs. The lithic networks of the Tongan state focused on Samoa and Fiji, with one adze sourced to the Society Islands 2,500 km from Tongatapu. To test the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were especially valued by Tongan elites and were an important source of political capital, we analyzed prestate lithics from Tongatapu and stone artifacts from Samoa. In the Tongan state, 66\% of worked stone tools were long-distance imports, indicating that interarchipelago connections intensified with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast, stone tools found in Samoa were from local sources, including tools associated with a monumental structure contemporary with the Tongan state. Network analysis of lithics entering the Tongan state and of the distribution of Samoan adzes in the Pacific identified a centralized polity and the products of specialized lithic workshops, respectively. These results indicate that a significant consequence of social complexity was the establishment of new types of specialized sites in distant geographic areas. Specialized sites were loci of long-distance interaction and formed important centers for the transmission of information, people, and materials in prehistoric Oceania.},

  abstract = {Basalts from French Polynesian islands occasionally display extremely high abundances and anomalous distributions of rare-earth elements (REE) and yttrium, whereas other incompatible element concentrations and O, Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios do not differ from those of “normal” basalts from the same area. The REE- and Y-enriched basalts contribute up to 15\% of the sample set, suggesting that this feature is more widespread than previously thought. REE-Y enrichment is related to the presence of rhabdophane-type REE-Y-phosphate identified through electron microprobe analyses in the most enriched sample and inferred from leaching experiments in the others. This phenomenon is confined to subaerially exposed basaltic sequences, indicating a close relationship to supergene processes. This is supported by negative Ce anomalies in these basalts, since decoupling of Ce from the other REE is restricted to oxidizing, low-temperature, aqueous environments. Similar Nd isotopic ratios for enriched and normal basalts allow us to exclude the possibility that additional REE and Y are derived from marine sediments or guano, but rather suggest an origin from the local basalts. Moreover, light REE enrichment in the REE-Y-phosphates suggests short migration distances of the fluids, supporting the conclusion that additional REE and Y were mobilized from weathered basalts and transported by descending meteoric waters.}

  abstract = {Attempts to assess the significance of subducted sediments in the genesis of island arc magmas have been limited by the lack of trace element data on pelagic oozes. Accordingly, we have analysed a series of pelagic clays and nannofossil oozes from the Nazca Plate for REE and other trace elements. A calculated average––Pacific Authigenic Weighted Mean Sediment (PAWMS)––exhibits light REE-enrichment (Lan/Ybn∼4.5), high contents of Ba and Sr, but low abundances of Rb, Nb and Ta. Most significant, however, is the occurrence of large, negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce*\textasciitilde 0.2). We have attempted to model the contribution of PAWMS-type material to the source of the magmas of the Mariana Island Arc, an intra-oceanic arc far removed from the effect of continent-derived detritus. Only small amounts of pelagic sediment, between 0.3 and 0.5\% of the source, are required to develop the small negative Ce anomalies, high Ba/La ratios, and high LIL/HFS element ratios characteristic of these and other arc lavas. However, a small fluid contribution from the dehydrating subducted oceanic crust is required to produce the high Rb/Ba observed in several Mariana suites. The ternary mixing between sediment, mantle host and dehydrating oceanic crust also produces very low Nb and Ta abundances in the arc lava source. However, the very high abundance of Sr (\&gt;1000ppm) and the estimated high 87Sr/86Sr ratio (\textasciitilde 0.7150) of PAWMS, results in a model 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7070. This is far higher than the measured ratios in the Mariana arc lavas (0.7033–0.7040) and may suggest that the subducted sediment has a lower Sr content (\&lt;200 ppm) or a lower 87Sr/86Sr ratio, or that the carbonate-rich component is not involved in source contamination.Volumetrically it would appear that much of the sediment approaching the Mariana trench (\textasciitilde 45 km3 Ma−1 per km of arc) may be recycled into the deeper mantle. This will have the effect of introducing high Ba, Sr, Th, 87Sr/86Sr, 208Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb material into the mantle. However, incorporation of such material cannot alone satisfactorily account for the trace element and isotope chemistry of ocean islands; oceanic sediments have LIL/Ta, Nb ratios far too high to produce the trace element characteristics of most intraplate magmas.}

Of particular interest are islands classified as Polynesian Outliers, where people speak Polynesian languages and have distinctly Polynesian cultural traits, but are located within the Melanesian or Micronesian cultural areas. While the classification of these groups as Polynesian is not in dispute, the material evidence for the movement between Polynesia and the Polynesian Outliers is exceedingly rare, unconfirmed, and in most cases, nonexistent. We report on the first comprehensive sourcing (using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) of obsidian and volcanic glass artifacts recovered from excavations on the Polynesian Outlier island of Tikopia. We find evidence for: (1) initial settlement followed by continued voyages between Tikopia and an island Melanesian homeland; (2) long-distance voyaging becoming much less frequent and continuing to decline; and (3) later voyaging from Polynesia marked by imports of volcanic glass from Tonga beginning at 765 cal yr BP (±54 yr). Later long-distance voyages from Polynesia were surprisingly rare, given the strong cultural and linguistic influences of Polynesia, and we suggest, may indicate that Tikopia was targeted by Tongans for political expansion.},

Melting of oceanic crusts cannot produce high-magnesian OIB lavas. Ancient oceanic crusts ({$>$}1 Ga) are isotopically too depleted to meet the required values of most OIB. Subducted oceanic crusts that have passed through subduction zone dehydration are likely to be depleted in water-soluble incompatible elements (e.g., Ba, Rb, Cs, U, K, Sr, Pb) relative to water-insoluble incompatible elements (e.g., Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti). Melting of residual crusts with such trace element composition cannot produce OIB. Oceanic crusts, if subducted into the lower mantle, will be {$>$}2\% denser than the ambient mantle at shallow lower mantle depths. This negative buoyancy will impede return of the subducted oceanic crusts into the upper mantle. If subducted oceanic crusts melt at the base of the mantle, the resultant melts are even denser than the ambient peridotitic mantle, perhaps by as much as ∼15\%. Neither in the solid state nor in melt form can bulk oceanic crusts subducted into the lower mantle return to upper mantle source regions of oceanic basalts. Deep portions of recycled oceanic lithosphere are important geochemical reservoirs hosting volatiles and incompatible elements as a result of metasomatism taking place at the interface between the low-velocity zone and the cooling and thickening oceanic lithosphere. These metasomatized and recycled deep portions of oceanic lithosphere are the most likely candidates for OIB sources in terms of petrology, geochemistry and mineral physics.},

A Dupal component represented by Samoa has high87Sr/86Sr , with low Pb ratios which are enriched in207Pb and208Pb. Nd isotope ratios of the Dupal component are slightly lower than for Mangaia. The Dupal isotope enrichment is coupled with high LIL/HFS element ratios relative to Mangaia. The Mangaia isotope enrichment is associated with low LIL/HFS element ratios comparable with or lower than MORB and indicates a time-integrated depletion in LIL elements in the source. However, inferred low ThU , and PbNb ratios indicate that Mangaia has been enriched in U but depleted in Pb relative to MORB. It is suggested that Mangaia could be derived from hydrothermally altered, subducted MORB. The Dupal component may include recycled subcontinental lithosphere.}

SiO2\% versus K2O\% relationship shows that the analyzed samples belong to two major groups: the basaltic andesitic and the andesitic ones. High-K basaltic andesites and low-K andesites occur too. Although emplaced on continental type basement (the North Anatolian Crystalline Swell), the Pontic eocene volcanics show elemental abundances closely comparable with typical island arc calc-alkaline suites, e.g. low SiO2\% range, low to moderate K2O\% and large cations (Cs, Rb, Sr, Ba, Pb) contents and REE patterns with fractionated light and almost flat heavy REE patterns. ΣREE and highly charged cations (Th, U, Hf, Sn, Zr) are slightly higher than typical calc-alkaline values. Ferromagnesian elements show variable values. Within the basaltic andesite group the increase of K\%, large cations, ΣREE, La/Yb ratio and high valency cations and the decrease of ferromagnesian element abundances with increasing SiO2\% content indicate that the rock types making up this group developed by crystalliquid fractionation of olivine and clinopyroxene from a basic parent magma. Trace element concentration suggest that the andesite group was not derived by crystal-liquid fractionation processes from the basaltic andesites, but could represent a distinct group of rocks derived from a different parent magma.},

  abstract = {People usually study the chronologies of archaeological sites and geological sequences using many different kinds of evidence, taking into account calibrated radiocarbon dates, other dating methods and stratigraphic information. Many individual case studies demonstrate the value of using statistical methods to combine these different types of information. I have developed a computer program, OxCal, running under Windows 3.1 (for IBM PCs), that will perform both 14C calibration and calculate what extra information can be gained from stratigraphic evidence. The program can perform automatic wiggle matches and calculate probability distributions for samples in sequences and phases. The program is written in C++ and uses Bayesian statistics and Gibbs sampling for the calculations. The program is very easy to use, both for simple calibration and complex site analysis, and will produce graphical output from virtually any printer.},

Although calibration curves are constructed from independently-dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international radiocarbon calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to c. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable 14C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the radiocarbon ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine 14C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals.},

  abstract = {In the mid-fifteenth century, one of the largest eruptions of the last 10 000 years occurred in the Central New Hebrides arc, forming the Kuwae caldera (12x6 km). This eruption followed a late maar phase in the pre-caldera edifice, responsible for a series of alternating hydromagmatic deposits and airfall lapilli layers. Tuffs related to caldera formation (≈ 120 m of deposits on a composite section from the caldera wall) were emitted during two main ignimbritic phases associated with two additional hydromagmatic episodes. The lower hydromagmatic tuffs from the precaldera maar phase are mainly basaltic andesite in composition, but clasts show compositions ranging from 48 to 60\% SiO2. The unwelded and welded ashflow deposits from the ignimbritic phases and the associated intermediate and upper hydromagmatic deposits also show a wide compositional range (60–73\% SiO2), but are dominantly dacitic. This broad compositional range is thought to be due to crystal fractionation. The striking evolution from one eruptive style (hydromagmatic) to the other (magmatic with emission of a large volume of ignimbrites) which occurred either over the tuff series as a whole, or at the beginning of each ignimbritic phase, is the most impressive characteristic of the caldera-forming event. This strongly suggests triggering of the main eruptive phases by magma-water interaction. A three-step model of caldera formation is presented: (1) moderate hydromagmatic (sequences HD 1–4) and magmatic (fallout deposits) activity from a central vent, probably over a period of months or years, affected an area slightly wider than the present caldera. At the end of this stage, intense seismic activity and extrusion of differentiated magma outside the caldera area occurred; (2) unhomogenized dacite was released during a hydromagmatic episode (HD 5). This was immediately followed by two major pyroclastic flows (PFD 1 and 2). The vents spread and intense magma-water interaction at the beginning of this stage decreased rapidly as magma discharge increased. Subsequent collapse of the caldera probably commenced in the southeastern sector of the caldera; (3) dacitic welded tuffs were emplaced during a second main phase (WFD 1–5). At the beginning of this phase, magma-water interaction continued, producing typical hydromagmatic deposits (HD 6). Caldera collapse extended to the northern part of the caldera. Previous C14 dates and records of explosive volcanism in ice from the south Pole show that the climactic phase of this event occurred in 1452 A.D.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Trace-element data for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and ocean island basalts (OIB) are used to formulate chemical systematics for oceanic basalts. The data suggest that the order of trace-element incompatibility in oceanic basalts is Cs ≈ Rb ≈ (≈ Tl) ≈ Ba(≈ W) {$>$} Th {$>$} U ≈ Nb = Ta ≈ K {$>$} La {$>$} Ce ≈ Pb {$>$} Pr (≈ Mo) ≈ Sr {$>$} P ≈ Nd ({$>$} F) {$>$} Zr = Hf ≈ Sm {$>$} Eu ≈ Sn (≈ Sb) ≈ Ti {$>$} Dy ≈ (Li) {$>$} Ho = Y {$>$} Yb. This rule works in general and suggests that the overall fractionation processes operating during magma generation and evolution are relatively simple, involving no significant change in the environment of formation for MORBs and OIBs. In detail, minor differences in element ratios correlate with the isotopic characteristics of different types of OIB components (HIMU, EM, MORB). These systematics are interpreted in terms of partial-melting conditions, variations in residual mineralogy, involvement of subducted sediment, recycling of oceanic lithosphere and processes within the low velocity zone. Niobium data indicate that the mantle sources of MORB and OIB are not exact complementary reservoirs to the continental crust. Subduction of oceanic crust or separation of refractory eclogite material from the former oceanic crust into the lower mantle appears to be required. The negative europium anomalies observed in some EM-type OIBs and the systematics of their key element ratios suggest the addition of a small amount (⩽1\% or less) of subducted sediment to their mantle sources. However, a general lack of a crustal signature in OIBs indicates that sediment recycling has not been an important process in the convecting mantle, at least not in more recent times (⩽2 Ga). Upward migration of silica-undersaturated melts from the low velocity zone can generate an enriched reservoir in the continental and oceanic lithospheric mantle. We propose that the HIMU type (eg St Helena) OIB component can be generated in this way. This enriched mantle can be re-introduced into the convective mantle by thermal erosion of the continental lithosphere and by the recycling of the enriched oceanic lithosphere back into the mantle.},

The results of geochemical analysis and thin section petrography indicate a very high probability that the adzes are Samoan with a close match to the islands of Manu'a. This provides a close correspondence with Rarotongan oral tradition. These sourcing results are discussed along with those available for adzes from other sites in the Southern Cooks. This evidence demonstrates significant interaction with West Polynesia during the early phase of Southern Cooks prehistory.},

  abstract = {Each of the 65 inhabited islands of Vanuatu hosts its own unique linguistic environment in which varying degrees of multilingualism are found. This paper defines various types of small-scale multilingual settings in Vanuatu and explores what sociohistorical factors have led to them. This paper is based on first-hand observations and primary data collected by the authors in four locations in the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu since 2016: two neighboring villages of Emae Island (Makatu and Tongamea), North Malekula, and on Maewo Island. The assessments of multilingualism in these examples from Vanuatu were qualitative, based on observations of sociolinguistic practices in each of these areas, as well as data from language history and language use surveys carried out in each place. Through defining and comparing the types of multilingualism present in the four case studies, we identify patterns in the social and historical processes that lead to various kinds of multilingualism: (a) interaction of linguistic and sociocultural identities and (b) mobility of both individuals and entire speech communities. The examples described in this paper are used to highlight the diversity of multilingualism found in Vanuatu and to explore how their differing linguistic environments and histories have contributed to their varying degrees of multilingualism. This paper makes an original contribution to knowledge about the small-scale multilingual situations in Vanuatu, offering descriptions of previously undocumented and endangered multilingual environments. Through an examination of the sociocultural motivations for multilingualism, alongside historical migrations of speaker groups and marked sociolinguistic identities, this paper contributes to research on why and how small-scale multilingualism can develop. Furthermore, this paper provides the foundation for future, more rigorous investigations into the small-scale multilingual situations of this highly understudied region.},

  abstract = {The Cook Islands are considered the “gateway” for human colonization of East Polynesia, the final chapter of Oceanic settlement and the last major region occupied on Earth. Indeed, East Polynesia witnessed the culmination of the greatest maritime migration in human history. Perennial debates have critiqued whether Oceanic settlement was purposeful or accidental, the timing and pathways of colonization, and the nature and extent of postcolonization voyaging—essential for small founding groups securing a lifeline between parent and daughter communities. Centering on the well-dated Tangatatau rockshelter, Mangaia, Southern Cook Islands, we charted the temporal duration and geographic spread of exotic stone adze materials—essential woodworking tools found throughout Polynesia— imported for more than 300 y beginning in the early AD 1300s. Using a technique requiring only 200 mg of sample for the geochemical analysis of trace elements and isotopes of fine-grained basalt adzes, we assigned all artifacts to an island or archipelago of origin. Adze material was identified from the chiefly complex on the Austral Islands, from the major adze quarry complex on Tutuila (Samoa), and from the Marquesas Islands more than 2,400 km distant. This interaction is the only dated example of down-the-line exchange in central East Polynesia where intermediate groups transferred commodities attesting to the interconnectedness and complexity of social relations fostered during postsettlement voyaging. For the Cook Islands, this exchange may have lasted into the 1600s, at least a century later than other East Polynesian archipelagos, suggesting that interarchipelago interaction contributed to the later development of social hierarchies.},

  abstract = {We report new K-Ar ages, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios and  concentrations of 34 trace elements in volcanic rocks from the Society Islands. Maximum ages of volcanism at Mehetia, Tahiti, and Maupiti indicate that volcanism in the Society Islands progresses southeastward at a rate of 11 cm/yr, which is consistent with current estimates of Pacific Plate motion. Tahaa has the largest range in ages, 2.3 million years. This large range reflects the eruption of highly undersaturated lavas during a posterosional phase that followed a volcanic hiatus of 1.2 million years. The entire range of isotope ratios observed in the Society Islands is nearly encompassed by the range observed on Tahaa: the two post-erosional lavas have among the most depleted isotopic signatures while the shield series lavas have the most enriched isotopic signatures. The isotopic and chemical evolution of Tahaa thus follows the Hawaiian pattern. There is a strong correlation between Sr and Nd isotope ratios and weaker correlations involving Pb isotope ratios. Compared to other oceanic islands, Sr and Nd ratios range to extremely high and low values respectively, but Pb isotope ratios are intermediate. The isotope correlations indicate the Society plume can be approximately modeled as consisting of two slightly heterogeneous end members. All magmas are moderately to strongly enriched in light rare earth elements as well as other incompatible elements. After exclusion of weathered (as indicated by anomalous Ba/Rb ratios) and differentiated lavas, there are strong correlations between Hf/Sm, Pb/Ce, Zr/Nb, Nb/U, and Rb/Sr and 87Sr/86Sr (and ɛNd and 207Pb/204Pb) and weaker correlations between Nb/La and La/Sm and 87Sr/86Sr (and ɛNd and 207Pb/204Pb). This indicates the variation in Hf/Sm, Pb/Ce, Zr/Nb, Nb/U, and Rb/Sr is largely due to variations in the composition of the source. This inference is confirmed by factor analysis. On the other hand, variance in the La/Sm ratio appears dominated by varying degrees of partial melting, perhaps because differences between the two end members in La/Sm are small. The high 87Sr/86Sr component in the plume has high 207Pb/204Pb and Pb/Ce and low Nb/U. These characteristics are consistent with this component consisting partly of sediment that has been subducted into the deep mantle. The low 87Sr/86Sr component in the Society plume appears to be also richer in incompatible elements than depleted mantle and is isotopically similar to the common component of plumes postulated by others. This component is most prevalent in late and very early stage Society magmas and thus probably constitutes the sheath of the Society plume. This sheath was most likely viscously entrained in the deep mantle during ascent of the plume.}

  abstract = {We investigated high-precision Pb isotope ratio analysis by multi-collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) using added thallium as an internal isotopic standard to correct for mass dependent isotopic fractionation. We compared MC-ICP-MS analysis of both an inter-laboratory standard, NBS 981, and geological samples to conventional thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). As expected, we found that analytical error in the latter was dominated by mass fractionation. In MC-ICP-MS, we found that fractionation appears to follow the exponential law, but that the fractionation coefficients, f, of Tl and Pb were not identical. This difference in fractionation coefficients cannot be compensated for by renormalizing to a different Tl isotopic composition as done in other studies. We found, however, that the fPb/fTl ratio was constant over the course of an analytical session, allowing fPb to be calculated from fTl. An exponential law correction was then applied to the Pb isotope measurements which effectively eliminates errors associated with mass fractionation. Precision for the MC-ICP-MS analyses ranged from a factor of 2 to a factor of 6 better than for TIMS analyses for the 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/206Pb ratios respectively. Residual error in the MC-ICP-MS analyses was dominated by error in the analysis of 204Pb, perhaps in part due to random errors introduced by correcting for a 204Hg isobaric interference. We also found systematic errors in the MC-ICP-MS analyses compared to TIMS determinations that may be due to uneven background and collector biases in the instrument used. We found that these systematic errors were the same for both NBS 981 and the geological samples, so accurate correction factors could be generated from the standard analyses to correct the sample analyses. MC-ICP-MS has the additional advantages of requiring less preparative chemistry, less instrument time, and considerably less labor overall.},

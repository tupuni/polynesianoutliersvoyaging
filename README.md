## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
-   [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
-   [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations
-   [:file_folder:
    supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):
    Supplementary materials including notes and other documents prepared
    and collected during the analysis.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

In order to install all of the dependencies required by the analyses
`devtools` is required (`install.packages("devtools")`. Additionally,
your R version needs to be >=4.0.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[main.zip](/archive/main.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj`
file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, open
`analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run
`rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console

## How to reproduce the analysis

-   1/ Download locally [pofatu/georoc-data](https://github.com/pofatu/georoc-data) and [pofatu/pofatu-data](https://github.com/pofatu/pofatu-data) repositories and unzip the SQLite database `georoc.sqlite.gz` (`dist/pofatu.sqlite` does not need unzipping). To reproduce the results please use Pofatu version v1.2 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4726799.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4726799) and Georoc version v1.0 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6782177.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6782177)
-   2/ Run the R script [helper-functions-globals](analysis/helper-functions-globals.R) after inserting the local path to the sqlite files.
-   3/ Run the R script [sql-queries](analysis/sql-queries.R).
-   4/ Run any of the R scripts in [paper](/analysis/paper) or in [supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials) to reproduce the figures in the paper or in the supplementary materials.
